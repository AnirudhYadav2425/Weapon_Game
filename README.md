# 🔫 Java Weapon Game Project

This is a **Java-based console application** demonstrating **object-oriented programming concepts** such as inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism through a simple game-like simulation involving weapons like guns, knives, and bombs.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 💣 Multiple weapon types: **Gun**, **Knife**, and **Bomb**
- 🎮 Simple interactive simulation using menu-driven input
- 🔁 Object-oriented structure with reusable and extendable code
- ⚙️ Demonstrates real-world use of **abstraction**, **inheritance**, and **method overriding**
